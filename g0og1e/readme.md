Files
------
The scripts in this folder are used to update hosts for g0og1e from specific URLs.
The python version script is strongly recommended, as the shell script version is just a demo for test.

hosts.py: python2 script, works for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

hosts.sh: shell script to copy hosts for g0og1e from specific website, works for Linux and MacOS.

To use hosts.py, please make sure you have installed python 2.7.6+ (but NOT 3.x). Just run 'python hosts.py' in the command line with Administrator or root privilege.

To use hosts.sh, please make sure your hosts DONOT contain google contents, such as 'xx.xx.xx.xx www.google.com'
